This project presents an intelligent Question Answering (QA) system built on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. The system enables students and learners to interactively query AI/ML study notes stored in PDF format and receive accurate, context-aware answers in natural language.
Traditional keyword-based search systems fail to understand the semantic meaning behind user queries. This system addresses that limitation by combining dense vector retrieval with a pre-trained language model generator, allowing meaningful, generative responses grounded in the actual study material.
The project uses two real AI/ML textbook PDFs as its knowledge base: ai_notes.pdf and ml 1.pdf. These serve as the data source from which content is extracted, chunked, vectorized, and ultimately queried.
